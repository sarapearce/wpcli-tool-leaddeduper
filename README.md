## Using

This package is used to use the WP-CLI tool to run a single command `wp cxl-intercom` to be able to dedupe/clean the Intercom database via the Intercom API.

After cloning the repo, be sure you are in the root directory, then run `wp cxl-intercom` which will then do all the api authentication and cleaning. 

NOTE: The keys are out of date, if you install and follow these directions, nothing will happen. 

To use this to clean your own Intercom API in Wordpress, update the command.php file with your own auth info, or point the auth to your appropriate environment variables.


## Installing

Installing this package requires WP-CLI v1.1.0 or greater. Update to the latest stable release with `wp cli update`.

Once you've done so, you can install this package with:

    wp package install git@github.com:sarapearce/cxl-intercom-lead-dedupe.git
